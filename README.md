# Bitmap Plasma - iOS Demo

This is the iOS version of the original Android NDK's Bitmap Plasma C/C++ library, which can be found at:
https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/tree/master/bitmap-plasma

## Modifications:
1. Supports both RGB565 and ARGB formats. The original one only works for RGB565.
2. Addes Touch-interaction.
3. Redesigned APIs to support cross-platforms.

## Requirements:
1. XCode
2. Swift 2
3. C/C++

## Improvements needed:
1. A better way to access to CGImage's bitmap-data directly.
2. GPU support.

## Any contribution is welcomed!
